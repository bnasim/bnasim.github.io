**Nasim Banu**

I am a tech enthusiast. Live in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia Canada. Work as a mentor at OpenClassroom & Udacity. Both are MOOC(Massive Online Open Classroom). I help students in doing web & mobile applications as a part of their learning. I review their code, unblock and guide them.

I thought about sharing my knowledge in my blog so that others who are learning can be helpful too.

Besides coding, I love hiking and exploring nature.
